# Collaborative Editing

Allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously. This can be done in real-time, so that collaborators can see the changes as they are made. Collaborative editing can be a great way to improve efficiency, as it allows team members to work together on a document without having to wait for others to finish their changes.
